## Some Fun Websites 
 1. [EvilOverlord.com](http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html)  
 >I was first introduced to this website 20+ years ago, and I go back and reread the lists every couple years. It quite thoroughly mocks movies for the various mistakes the villians make.  
 2. [http://www.eviloverlord.com/](https://www.awkwardzombie.com/awkward-zombie/coin-battle)  
 >Another website I was introduced a long time ago. The artist for this series of comic panels originally posted on Deviantart.com, but eventually moved to her own website. Most of the comics are based on her experience playing video games. _And she captures it so perfectly!_  
 3. [The Order of the Stick Webcomic](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html)  
 >I don't remember when I was first introduced to this, but it tickled my DnD funny bone as it is _exactly_ the kind of shenanigans that go on in a normal DnD game.
